The AV9000 may be connected to XLink 500 in order to provide water Velocity, Temperature, and Flow measurements.

In order to connect the two devices together, please cut the cable of the AV9000.  Then connect 4 of the AV9000 wires identified by their color to the XLink:

Green GND 					GND      #7         
Red 12V+ 					SWD +12V #8

Please load the provided XLink setup file and script file into XLink using LinkComm.   

Provide 12V power to XLink.
Use LinkComm to connect to XLink. 
LinkComm Menu -> Import -> choose the setup file, then choose the script file.
Send the setup to XLink and start recording.
Note the measurement values update once a minute.

* Xlink script will setup the AV9000
* Once setup, the AV9000 will collect data once a minute.
* Please note that without changing the script, it is not possible to get data more frequently than once a minute.
